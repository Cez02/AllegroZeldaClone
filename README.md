# AllegroZeldaClone
A Legend of Zelda clone made in Allegro 5 and C for a project for University.

## Installation

Currently the project is written for Linux only. Perhaps with time I will learn the ways of creating cmake files.

### Dependencies

Apart from the gcc compiler, you will also need allegro 5 dependencies in order to build the game:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:allegro/5.2
sudo apt-get install liballegro*5.2 liballegro*5-dev
```

### Commands
In the cloned/downloaded directory simply launch the `build-and-run.sh` bash file or `build.sh` and launch the game for the build directory (launching it from outside of the build directory will prevent it from loading the necessary assets).
